📌 README: Ensemble Stacking Model (XGBoost + CNN + LSTM) for Seizure Detection
📖 Overview
This project implements an ensemble stacking model combining XGBoost, CNN, and LSTM to enhance seizure detection from EEG signals. The model leverages:

CNN for spatial feature extraction.
LSTM for temporal sequence learning.
XGBoost as the meta-classifier for final decision-making.
The goal is to improve seizure prediction accuracy using deep learning and machine learning techniques.

⚙️ Model Architecture
1️⃣ CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
✅ Extracts spatial patterns from EEG signals.
✅ Uses convolutional layers + pooling layers to detect critical EEG features.

2️⃣ LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
✅ Captures temporal dependencies in EEG signals.
✅ Handles long-term dependencies in sequential brainwave data.

3️⃣ XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
✅ Acts as the final meta-classifier in the stacking ensemble.
✅ Learns from CNN and LSTM outputs to make robust predictions.

4️⃣ Stacking Strategy
✅ CNN & LSTM generate feature representations.
✅ XGBoost takes their outputs and optimizes classification accuracy.

📂 Dataset
The model is trained on EEG seizure datasets such as:
CHB-MIT EEG dataset
